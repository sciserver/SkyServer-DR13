      <p>Take another look at the query you used to get your first 1,000 quasars:</p>
          <table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" width="100%" id="AutoNumber2" bgcolor="#552255">
            <tr>
              <td width="100%"><p></p>
              <p><br>select top 1000<br> 
              objid, modelmag_u, modelmag_g, modelmag_r, modelmag_i, modelmag_z,z</p>
              <p>from<br>
              SpecPhoto</p>
              <p>where<br>
              (specclass=3 or specclass=4)<br>
              and zconf > .35</p>
              <p></p>
              </td>
            </tr>
          </table>

      <p>The query you used limits the objects it returns by applying 
      one "constraint" - the query returns only objects with zconf &gt; .35. 
      Zconf is a measure of the statistical confidence level in the 
      redshift measurement. The query only returns quasars for which we 
      are more than 35% certain that the measured redshift is correct.</p>
      <p>Try modifying the query. A couple of ideas would be to change or 
      eliminate the confidence level zconf, or to add a statement in the "where" clause to 
      search for quasars less than a certain magnitude (such as u &lt; 20). Or you could try searching for various lines in the quasars' spectra.</p>

      <p>When you are dealing with a large database such as the SDSS, you need to use tools such as the SQL Search tool 
      to find the data you want.</p>
      <table class=rchallenge width=600 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=0>
        <tr>
          <td width="100%"><p><strong>Research Challenge. </strong>
          Modify the query slightly to obtain a different set of data. 
          For example, look at only quasars with poorly measured redshifts (set 
          zconf &lt; some number). Maybe you want to look at very red quasars 
          by setting the i and z magnitudes larger than a certain number. 
          You could also search for very blue 
          quasars using a similar technique.</p>
          <p>Think of a question about quasars that you want 
          to answer, and modify the query to get the data that will 
          let you answer that question. Analyze the data using a spreadsheet, then 
          draw conclusions about the quasars. When you finish your analysis, <a
