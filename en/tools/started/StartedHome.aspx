<p>Welcome to the SkyServer tools pages!</p>

<p>SkyServer's tools allow you to access all publicly available data 
from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, one of the largest surveys of the night 
sky ever made. You can use SDSS data to learn about the way the universe 
works, or even to do original scientific research!</p>

<p>The Getting Started pages will tell you what types of data are 
available on SkyServer, and which tools are best for accessing which types 
of data. These tools give you many different ways 
of looking at our data. Some tools also have help pages that will give you 
more specific information on how to use the tool.<p>

<h1>Types of Data</h1>

<p>SkyServer offers access to many different types of data, but 
most users will usually focus on four types: images, 
spectra, photometric data, and spectroscopic data. The table below shows 
what each type of data means:</p>

<table width=600 border=1 cellpadding=3 cellspacing=1>
  <tr>
    <td width=80>Images</td>
    <td ><p>Pictures of celestial objects, stored as .jpg or .fits files</p></td>
    <td width=200 align=center><img align=center src="images/sampleimage.jpg" width="200" height="160"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Spectra</td>
    <td><p>Graphs of the amount of light emitted by an object at different 
    wavelengths. Spectra can be used to study the compositions and temperatures 
    of objects, as well as their distances from Earth.</p></td>
    <td align=center><img align=center src="images/samplespec.gif" width="200" height="160"></td>    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Photometric Data</td>
    <td><p>Various quantities measured from an object's image, such as its 
    brightness or size</p></td>
    <td align=center><img align=center src="images/photodata.jpg" width="200" height="160"></td>    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Spectroscopic Data</td>
    <td><p>Various quantities measured from an object's spectrum, such as 
    its spectral type or redshift.</p></td>
    <td align=center><img align=center src="images/specdata.jpg" width="200" height="160"></td>    
  </tr>
</table>

<h1>Tools</h1>

<p>The table below gives a short description of each of SkyServer's tools, 
listed from the most simple and general to the most complex and specialized. 
The table also shows when you might use each tool, based on what information 
you know already and what information you want to find out. Click on the name of 
a tool for more information on what it does and how to use it.</p>
