	The SDSS project uses 5-color images to detect millions of objects 
	(over 300 million stars and galaxies) over the whole sky. As soon
	as these objects are observed, a sophisticated software algorithm selects targets
	for further studies. Using another instrument, we take detailed <em>spectra</em>, 
	measurements of the energy given off by an object as a function of its wavelength. 
	These spectra tell much more about an object than its image. Spectra can 
	be used to estimate a 
	galaxy's distance or chemical composition, or to determine a star's age.

	The measured spectra are processed automatically by our software. The software 
	identifies individual features in the spectra: emission and absorption lines. Comparing
	the observed lines to a list of laboratory measurements, we can infer the relative velocity of the
	galaxy or star with respect to Earth. If the object is moving away from us, its spectral lines are shifted 
	towards longer wavelengths; this is the famous <em>Doppler shift</em>. Since the universe
	expands uniformly, objects that are twice as far are receding from us twice as fast. 
	We can use this fact to measure distances to galaxies, and eventually to create a three-dimensional
	map of the universe.

	On the images of the spectra you can see annotations: these show the different spectral 
	lines that our software has found. The type of object and its redshift is written on the bottom of 
	the image as well.
